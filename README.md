 MSU Data Analytics BootCamp Module 15 Challenge

Code file names: 'index.html', 'eathquakedataapp.js', and 'styles.css'

The code in this repository is for a webpage that implements D3 and Leaflet JavaScript libraries to create and display dynamically updating map of USGS earthquake data for the past seven days (from the current date). Upon opening the webpage a map of the world is displayed with circular markers that denote the location, magnitude (proportional to marker size), and depth (marker color with legend) of every recorded earthquake within the past seven days. Clicking on a marker results in a information box appearing on the screen that tells the user the exact magnitude, depth, and relative location of the earthquake. The map will update (upon refresh) when new data becomes available, since the earthquake information is pulled using GeoJSON directly from the constatly updated USGS seven day earthquake database.

*Code sourcing statement*
-----------------------

I did use a natural language description of the desired code's functions entered into ChatGPT 3.5 to help with code syntax. I did copy pieces of that code in order to be more efficient, but I tailored it to fit all of the desired functions of this particular project. I did not directly copy and paste any of this code from the internet otherwise (e.g., from StackExchange or any other webpage). I did not seek any assistance or use code written by my peers or instructors for this challenge.

End of code sourcing statement.
